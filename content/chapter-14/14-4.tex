This chapter has demonstrated how to implement some of the most common parallel patterns using DPC++ and SYCL features, including built-in functions and libraries.\par

The SYCL and DPC++ ecosystems are still developing, and we expect to uncover new best practices for these patterns as developers gain more experience with the language and from the development of productiongrade applications and libraries.\par
