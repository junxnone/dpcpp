SYCL provides for assigning names defined as lambdas in case tools need it and for debugging purposes (e.g., to enable displays in terms of userdefined names). Throughout most of this book, anonymous lambdas have been used for kernels because names are not needed when using DPC++ (except for passing of compile options as described with lambda naming discussion in Chapter 10). They are also made optional as of the SYCL 2020 provisional.\par

When we have an advanced need to mix SYCL tools from multiple vendors on a codebase, the tooling may require that we name lambdas. This is done by adding a <class uniquename> to the SYCL action construct in which the lambda is used (e.g., parallel\_for). This naming allows tools from multiple vendors to interact in a defined way within a single compilation and can also help by displaying kernel names that we define within debug tools and layers.\par
