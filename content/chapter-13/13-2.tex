The Intel Developer Zone hosts a forum for discussing the DPC++ compiler, DPC++ Library (Chapter 18), DPC++ Compatibility Tool (for CUDA migrationâ€”discussed later in this chapter), and gdb included in the oneAPI toolkit (this chapter touches on debugging too). This is an excellent place to post questions about writing code, including suspected compiler bugs. You will find posts from some of the book authors on this forum doing exactly that, especially while writing this book. The forum is available online at https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/oneapidata-parallel-c-compiler.\par

The online oneAPI DPC++ language reference is a great resource to find a complete list of the classes and member definitions, details on compiler options, and more.\par
