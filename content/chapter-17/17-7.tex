In this chapter, we have introduced how pipelining maps an algorithm to the FPGA’s spatial architecture. We have also covered concepts that can help us to decide whether an FPGA is useful for our applications and that can help us get up and running developing code faster. From this starting point, we should be in good shape to browse vendor programming and optimization manuals and to start writing FPGA code! FPGAs provide performance and enable applications that wouldn’t make sense on other accelerators, so we should keep them near the front of our mental toolbox!\par
