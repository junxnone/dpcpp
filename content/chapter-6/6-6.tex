In this chapter, weâ€™ve described Unified Shared Memory, a pointer-based strategy for data management. We covered the three types of allocations that USM defines. We discussed all the different ways that we can allocate and deallocate memory with USM and how data movement can be either explicitly controlled by us (the programmers) for device allocations or implicitly controlled by the system for shared allocations. Finally, we discussed how to query the different USM capabilities that a device supports and how to query information about USM pointers in a program.\par

Since we have not discussed synchronization in this book in detail yet, there is more on USM in later chapters when we discuss scheduling, communications, and synchronization. Specifically, we cover these additional considerations for USM in Chapters 8, 9, and 19.\par

In the next chapter, we will cover the second strategy for data management: buffers.\par
