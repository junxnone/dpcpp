Since USM is based on C++ pointers, it is a natural place to start for existing pointer-based C++ codes. Existing functions that take pointers as parameters continue to work without modification. In the majority of cases, the only changes required are to replace existing calls to malloc or new with USM-specific allocation routines that we will discuss later in this chapter.\par
