The next two chapters provide a deeper look into how to manage data. There are two different approaches that complement each other: Unified Shared Memory (USM) and buffers. USM exposes a different level of abstraction for memory than buffers—USM has pointers, and buffers are a higher-level interface. This chapter focuses on USM. The next chapter will focus on buffers.\par

Unless we specifically know that we want to use buffers, USM is a good place to start. USM is a pointer-based model that allows memory to be read and written through regular C++ pointers.\par
