The DPC++ library is a companion to the DPC++ compiler. It helps us with solutions for portions of our heterogeneous applications, using pre-built and tuned libraries for common functions and parallel patterns. The DPC++ library allows explicit use of the C++ STL API within kernels, it streamlines cross-architecture programming with Parallel STL algorithm extensions, and it increases the successful application of parallel algorithms with custom iterators. In addition to support for familiar libraries (libstdc++, libc++, MSVS), DPC++ also provides full support for SYCL built-in functions. This chapter overviewed options for leveraging the work of others instead of having to write everything ourselves, and we should use that approach wherever practical to simplify application development and often to realize superior performance.\par
