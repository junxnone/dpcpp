Vectors are collections of data. These can be useful because parallelism in our computers comes from collections of compute hardware, and data is often processed in related groupings (e.g., the color channels in an RGB pixel). Sound like a marriage made in heaven? It is so important, weâ€™ll spend a chapter discussing the merits of vector types and how to utilize them. We will not dive into vectorization in this chapter, since that varies based on device type and implementations. Vectorization is covered in Chapters 15 and 16.\par

This chapter seeks to address the following questions:\par

\begin{itemize}
	\item What are vector types?
	\item How much do I really need to know about the vector 	interface?
	\item Should vector types be used to express parallelism? 
	\item When should I use vector types?
\end{itemize}

We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of available vector types using working code examples and highlight the most important aspects of exploiting vector types.\par
