The error detection and handling mechanisms discussed in this chapter have been host-based. They are mechanisms through which the host program can detect and deal with something that may have gone wrong either in the host program or potentially during execution of kernels on devices. What we have not covered is how to signal, from within the device code that we write, that something has gone wrong. This omission is not a mistake, but quite intentional.\par

SYCL explicitly disallows C++ exception handling mechanisms (such as throw) within device code, because there are performance costs for some types of device that we usually donâ€™t want to pay. If we detect that something has gone wrong within our device code, we should signal the error using existing non-exception-based techniques. For example, we could write to a buffer that logs errors or return some invalid result from our numeric calculation that we define to mean that an error occurred. The right strategy in these cases is very application specific.\par
