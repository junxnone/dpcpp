In this chapter, we introduced synchronous and asynchronous errors, covered the default behavior to expect if we do nothing to manage errors that might occur, and covered the mechanisms used to handle asynchronous errors at controlled points in our application. Error management strategies are a major topic in software engineering and a significant percentage of the code written in many applications. SYCL integrates with the C++ knowledge that we already have when it comes to error handling and provides flexible mechanisms to integrate with whatever our preferred error management strategy is.\par
