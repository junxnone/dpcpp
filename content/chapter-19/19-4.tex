
This chapter provided a high-level introduction to memory model and atomic classes. Understanding how to use (and how not to use!) these classes is key to developing correct, portable, and efficient parallel programs.\par

Memory models are an overwhelmingly complex topic, and our focus here has been on establishing a base for writing real applications. If more information is desired, there are several websites, books, and talks dedicated to memory models referenced in the following\par
