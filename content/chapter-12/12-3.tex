Our “curious” program examples, used earlier in this chapter, utilize the most used SYCL device class member functions (i.e., is\_host, is\_cpu, is\_gpu, is\_accelerator, get\_info, has\_extension). These member functions are documented in the SYCL specification in a table titled “Member functions of the SYCL device class” (in SYCL 1.2.1, it is Table 4.18).\par

The “curious” program examples also queried for information using the get\_info member function. There is a set of queries that must be supported by all SYCL devices, including a host device. The complete list of such items is described in the SYCL specification in a table titled “Device information descriptors” (in SYCL 1.2.1, it is Table 4.20).\par
