The most portable programs will query the devices that are available in a system and adjust their behavior based on runtime information. This chapter opens the door to the rich set of information that is available to allow such tailoring of our code to adjust to the hardware that is present at runtime.\par

Our programs can be made more portable, more performance portable, and more future-proof by parameterizing our application to adjust to the characteristics of the hardware. We can also test that the hardware present falls within the bounds of any assumptions we have made in the design of our program and either warn or abort when hardware is found that lies outside the bounds of our assumptions.\par
