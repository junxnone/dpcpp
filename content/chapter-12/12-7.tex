The queries described in this chapter are performed through runtime APIs (get\_info), meaning that the results are not known until runtime. This covers many use cases, but the SYCL specification is also undergoing work to provide compile-time querying of properties, when they can be known by a toolchain, to allow more advanced programming techniques such as templating of kernels based on properties of devices. Compile-time adaptation of code based on queries is not possible with the existing runtime queries, and this ability can be important for advanced optimizations or when writing kernels that use some extensions. The interfaces were not defined well enough yet at the time of writing to describe those interfaces in this book, but we can look forward to much more powerful query and code adaptation mechanisms that are coming soon in SYCL and DPC++! Look to the online oneAPI DPC++ language reference and the SYCL specifications for updates.\par
