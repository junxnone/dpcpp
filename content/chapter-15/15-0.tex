Over the last few decades, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have evolved from specialized hardware devices capable of drawing images on a screen to general-purpose devices capable of executing complex parallel kernels. Nowadays, nearly every computer includes a GPU alongside a traditional CPU, and many programs may be accelerated by offloading part of a parallel algorithm from the CPU to the GPU.\par

In this chapter, we will describe how a typical GPU works, how GPU software and hardware execute a SYCL application, and tips and techniques to keep in mind when we are writing and optimizing parallel kernels for a GPU.\par
