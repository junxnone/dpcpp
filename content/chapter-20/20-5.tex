There is already a lot of excitement around SYCL and DPC++, and this is just the beginning! We (as a community) have a long path ahead of us, and it will take significant continued effort to distil the best practices for heterogeneous programming and to design new language features that strike the desired balance between performance, portability, and productivity.\par

We need your help! If your favorite feature of C++ (or any other programming language) is missing from SYCL or DPC++, please reach out to us. Together, we can shape the future direction of SYCL, DPC++, and ISO C++.\par
